The documentation is not here!

So far it's on the network share.


## TODO

 * define pip dependencies
 * save migration state on a database table
 * Add link to my first commit, so old code can be easily reached, no need to
 * remove internacionalization. It is adding a huge usability buron on the system.
 * Re-implment the whole survey thing using reactive.js. OR other,  althought I strongly suggest reactive.js if we want to avoid bloat
 * make the apache script accept a host
 * try the bootstrap script with a PASSWORD environment variable (experiment)
